Find 5 consecutive integers that are not prime.

\doublespacing

\textbf{Solution:} Recall that \textbf{Theorem 4} states that for every positive integer $n$, there is a sequence of $n$ consecutive positive integers containing no primes. More over, if $n$ is a positive integer, and $x=(n+1)!+2$, then $x,x+1,x+2,...,x+(n-1)$ are not prime. Take $n=5$, then
\begin{align*}
    x   &= 6!+2 = 720 + 2 = 722=(2)(361)\\
    x+1 &= 6!+3 = 720 + 3 = 723=(3)(241)\\
    x+2 &= 6!+4 = 720 + 4 = 724=(2)(362)\\
    x+3 &= 6!+5 = 720 + 5 = 725=(5)(145)\\
    x+4 &= 6!+6 = 720 + 6 = 726=(2)(363)
\end{align*}

We have thus found 5 consecutive integers that are not prime.
