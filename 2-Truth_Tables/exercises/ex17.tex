Find a formula involving the connectives $\wedge$, $\vee$, and $\neg$ that has the following truth table:

\[
\begin{array}{|cc||c|}
\hline
P & Q & ??? \\
\hline
F & F & F \\
F & T & T \\
T & F & T \\
T & T & F \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

\textbf{Solution:}  Consider $(P \wedge \neg Q) \vee (\neg P \wedge Q)$ as this was the equivalent formula to $P + Q$ in \textbf{Exercise 3}.
