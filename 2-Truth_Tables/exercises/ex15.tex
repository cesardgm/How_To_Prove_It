How many lines will there be in the truth table for a statement containing \(n\) variables?

\textbf{Solution:} Consider a single proposition, for example, \(P\), which can be either true or false. Thus, each variable has two possible values. Since each variable is independent of the others, the total number of combinations increases exponentially with the number of variables. Specifically, one variable has \(2^1 = 2\) possibilities; two variables have \(2 \times 2 = 2^2 = 4\) possibilities; and three variables have \(2 \times 2 \times 2 = 2^3 = 8\) possibilities. Consequently, for \(n\) variables, there are \(2^n\) possible combinations, or equivalently, lines in the truth table.
