What are the truth sets of the following statements? List a few elements of the truth set if you can.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Elizabeth Taylor was once married to $x$.
    \item $x$ is a logical connective studied in Section 1.1.
    \item $x$ is the author of this book.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Elizabeth Taylor was famously married eight times to seven different men, so the truth set of this statement includes all of her former husbands.

\begin{align*}
\{ x \ | \ &\text{Elizabeth Taylor was once married to } x \} \equiv \{\\
&\text{Conrad Hilton Jr.}, \\
&\text{Michael Wilding}, \\
&\text{Mike Todd}, \\
&\text{Eddie Fisher}, \\
&\text{Richard Burton}, \\
&\text{John Warner}, \\
&\text{Larry Fortensky}\}
\end{align*}

    \item $\{ x \ | \ x \text{ is a logical connective studied in Section 1.1} \} \equiv \{\wedge, \vee, \neg\}$
    \item $\{ x \ | \ x \text{ is the author of this book} \} \equiv \{\text{Daniel J. Velleman}\}$
\end{enumerate}
