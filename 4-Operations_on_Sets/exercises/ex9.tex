It was shown in this section that for any sets $A$ and $B$, $(A \cup B) \mybackslash B \subseteq A$. Give an example of two sets $A$ and $B$ for which $(A \cup B) \mybackslash B \neq A$.

\textbf{Solution:} Suppose $A = \{ 1,2,3,4\}$ and $B = \{4,5,6,7\}$, then $A \cup B = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$.
Hence, $(A \cup B) \mybackslash B = \{1,2,3\} \not\equiv \{1,2,3,4 \} = A$.
